# Chwitter - A Twitter-inspired Pet Adoption Directory

Inspired by Twitter's old website layout in 2014, Chwitter is built as a platform to raise awareness of animals in need of pet owners through a central pet adoption directory. Animal shelters, pet welfare organisations, and individuals who are keen to adopt pets, or raise awareness of stray animals in the vicinity are able to contribute to this platform.
