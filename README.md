## 🐥 Chwitter - A Twitter-inspired Pet Adoption Directory

Inspired by Twitter's old website layout in 2014, Chwitter is built as a platform to raise awareness of animals in need of pet owners through a central pet adoption directory. Animal shelters, pet welfare organisations, and individuals who are keen to adopt pets, or raise awareness of stray animals in the vicinity are able to contribute to this platform.

## 📝 Process

This is my capstone project during my course at General Assembly. I was given 2 weeks or so to complete this project.

Using a Kanban board, I planned out the Ice Box items that I wanted to implement in my project. I placed myself in the shoes of potential users and the administrator overseeing the application. I had to take into consideration the navigation of webpages for visitors with unauthorised access, or when an invalid url has been entered. With these in mind, I drafted the layout, design, features and React components of the application in a wireframe.
